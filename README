2048 AI

This is my first project applying a neural network to solve some kind of
problem. The neural network used is a CNN, convolutional neural network that
uses ideas in RL, reinforcement learning, to learn over time.

I template code from deeplearningandneuralnetworks.com to learn and
start and then heavily modified it with ideas from "Deep Reinforcement
Learning for 2048", a paper written by Antoine Dediu and Jonothan Amar.

The project was never made to be used by anyone but me so I don't plan
on updating it, nor am I an expert an ML. Because of this, any ideas
and concepts used in the code shouldn't be taken seriously.

My goal was to meet the expectations that the MIT 2048 paper achieved with
a random policy network with a CNN and RL, but it actually exceeded it
with some different parameters.
